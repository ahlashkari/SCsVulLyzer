# Smart Contracts Volnerability Analyzer (SCsVolLyzer)


As part of the Understanding Cybersecurity Series (UCS), SCsVolLyzer is a Python open-source project to extract features to profile Smart Contracts (SCs) for vulnerability detection.   

The SCsVolLyzer is a Python-based tool designed to analyze and extract key metrics from Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity. It employs a suite of functions to dissect the contract's source code, compiling it to obtain its abstract syntax tree (AST), bytecode, and opcodes. The analyzer calculates entropy of the bytecode to assess its randomness and security, determines the frequency of certain opcodes to understand the contract's complexity, and evaluates the usage of key Solidity keywords to gauge coding patterns. This modular and extensible tool provides a comprehensive snapshot of a smart contract's structure and behavior, facilitating developers and auditors in optimizing and securing Ethereum blockchain applications.

# Installation

You must install the requirements in your system before you can begin installing or running anything. To do so, you can easily run this command:

```bash
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You are now ready to install SCsVolLyzer. In order to do so, you should run this command, which will install the SCsVolLyzer package in your system:

```bash
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Finally, to execute the program, run this command:

```bash
python main.py path_to_solidity_source_file.sol
```
Also, this project has been successfully tested on Windows10, OS X.

## Statistical Information Calculation

Only one mathematical functions is used to extract different features. You can see how those functions are calculated in the NLFlowLyzer below:

1. **calculate_bytecode_entropy()**
The function calculate_bytecode_entropy computes the entropy of a given bytecode sequence using Shannon's entropy formula. It first constructs a frequency distribution by counting the occurrences of each unique bytecode element, representing them as probabilities by dividing the count of each element by the total length of the sequence. These probabilities are then used as the probabilities of occurrence in the entropy calculation. Shannon's entropy, denoted as H(X), is defined as the sum of the negative of the product of each probability (p(x)) and its base-2 logarithm (-log2(p(x))), summed over all unique elements in the sequence. This formula, H(X) = -Σ(p(x) * log2(p(x))), quantifies the amount of uncertainty or information content in the bytecode sequence, where higher values imply greater randomness and lower values indicate more predictability in the sequence. ([https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/11/entropy-a-key-concept-for-all-data-science-beginners/#:~:text=Entropy%20measures%20the%20amount%20of,higher%20uncertainty%20have%20higher%20entropy.])
